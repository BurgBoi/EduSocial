# QuickSource
This branch shows the original code where my team tried to create a server to client and vice versa system to create accounts and etc. This code in this branch is not finished and will produce bugs. If you build the code into a jar file, it will likely do nothing as it requires a QuickSourceServer.jar file running at the same time on the same computer which isn't a finished application yet.
